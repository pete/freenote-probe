Template: freenote-probe/team_name
Type: string
Default: petta
Description: Name of your FreeNote team
 You can register or join a team to accumulate credits.  Leaving the default
 (petta) is fine in most cases.

Template: freenote-probe/pin_code
Type: string
Default: 1234
Description: PIN code for the team which you're registered.
 If you've started your own team or joined another, you will need to change
 the PIN code to one assigned to you by your team.  You do not need to change
 this if you're using the default FreeNote team (petta).
