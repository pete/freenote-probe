  For DNS resolution, the FreeNote Probe uses a modified version
  of the Ares asynchronous resolver library.  Our modified version 
  of libares is redistributed under the original terms of the MIT license 
  (free software).  See the comments at the top of src/lib/libares/ares.h for 
  the full license text.
  
  For ICMP/ping functionality, we adapted the public domain code
  of Mike Muuss, found at http://ftp.arl.mil/~mike/ .
